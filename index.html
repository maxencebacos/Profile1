				<h1>Hello, I am Maxence !  </h1>

				<p>
					 Hey there, I'm Maxence! I'm 18 years old and I come from Nantes. I absolutely love wakeboarding, surfing, and music. These three things are my passion and my escape from the stresses of everyday life.

				<h2>Hobbies </h2>
					<p> As I said before, I am passionate about watersports. Wakeboarding and surfing give me an incredible adrenaline rush that's hard to describe - there's nothing quite like carving through the water, feeling the wind in my hair and the spray of the sea on my face. Overall, these disciplines bring me joy and a sense of connection - to nature, to myself, and to the world around me. </p>

				<h2> Passions </h2>
					<p> My passions are travelling and music.  Music is my outlet for expressing my emotions and creativity. Whether I'm writing songs or playing my guitar, it brings me a sense of fulfillment that's hard to find anywhere else.  </p>

				<h2> Projects </h2>
				<p>My life project is to combine two of my passions - surfing and marketing - by moving close to the Atlantic Ocean and working in marketing for a sports company. This project is the perfect blend of my interests, as it allows me to immerse myrself in the world of surfing while utilizing my marketing skills to promote the sport. The idea of living in a tropical paradise and surfing in crystal-clear waters every day is undoubtedly enticing, but it's the opportunity to work in marketing for a sport company that truly excites me. I see the potential to make a meaningful impact by connecting people with the joy and thrill of surfing, while also contributing to the growth of the sport on a larger scale. </p>
